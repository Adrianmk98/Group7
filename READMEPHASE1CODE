ThreadedKernel's selfTest() method was modified for alarm class.
selfTest() method added to Alarm class.

Alarm Tests: threads created and put to sleep through "waitUntil" method.
    Threads with longer wait times will be woken later, even if they were added first (priority queue working).
    Even when wait times are large negative values, threads will simply be woken up during the next timerInterrupt call
